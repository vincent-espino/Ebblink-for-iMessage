# Ebblink-for-iMessage
Ebblink for iMessage is an extension to the version of Ebblink already live on the App Store. More information is avaiable here: https://ebbl.ink/index.php

The current iMessage version is capable of generating links of images that can be shared with other images. These images will expire after a user-defined amount of time; the current version supports 30 and 60 minutes.

This project was created during my capstone course in the Fall of 2016. It gave me a great amount of development with Xcode and Objective-C.
