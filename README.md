# Ebblink-for-iMessage
Ebblink for iMessage is an extension to the version of Ebblink already live on the App Store. More information about the main app is avaiable here: https://ebbl.ink/index.php

The current iMessage version is capable of generating image links that can be shared with anyone. These links will expire after a user-defined amount of time; the current version supports 30 and 60 minutes.

This project was created during my capstone course in the Fall of 2016. It gave me a great amount of experience using Xcode and Objective-C.

To run the project, download or pull it and open the Ebblink.xcworkspace file, then press the Play button in Xcode.
